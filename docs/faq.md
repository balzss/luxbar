# FAQ

### Who is this intended for?

For everyone who wants a responsive navigation bar that looks good on every screensize, lightweight and easy to implement.

### Why should I use this instead of existing solutions (e.g. Bootstrap's navbar)?

Existing "premade" navbars are usually packed with a full blown CSS framework and rely heavily on JS. If you are already using Bootstrap for your site maybe it's not worth it but I would still recommend giving it a try for the fancy colors and animations.

### How light it is actually?

Around 2KB miniefied and gzipped.

### What are the future plans/TODO?

- Add more themes and animations
- Add options to use the hamburger menu on every screensize
- Add more (justified, centered) alignment options
- Add support for opening sideways
